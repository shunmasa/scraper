You might notice that we're reaching out on a Friday this time, instead of our usual Wednesday. Why the change? Well, we want to set you up for a productive and educational weekend ahead!<p>In our second last issue, <a href="/newsletter/rust-101-the-best-learning-resources-compiled/">Rust 101: The Best Learning Resources Compiled</a>, we explored the best resources to kickstart your journey with Rust. The positive reactions were overwhelming, and we are thrilled to see so many of you eager to learn. But what comes next after you have written your first "Hello, World!" program in Rust? The answer is simple: Projects, projects, projects! This is the best way to retain and build upon what you've learned so far.<p>There's no better method to solidify your understanding of a programming language than by building something from scratch. That is why this edition is dedicated to inspiring you with project ideas tailored for different skill levels. Whether you're a beginner looking for a small weekend project or an intermediate developer aiming for something more ambitious, we've got you covered.<p>So, let's turn those learning resources into practical experience and dive into the world of Rust projects!
